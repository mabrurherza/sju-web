The LH-series is a submersible three-phase cast iron high head drainage pump. Being the pump cylindrical and slim, it can be installed in a well casing for deep well dewatering. The center flange construction assures a stable installation even if it is fixed by the discharge pipe. The top discharge, flow-thru design provides maximum motor cooling efficiency allowing continuous operation at low water levels and extended dry-run capability. The pump incorporates seal pressure relief ports that prevent the pumping pressure from applying to the shaft seal.
