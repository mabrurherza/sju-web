STANDARD MOTOR

Electrical design
As standard, CMG motors have the following design and operating parameters. Performance data is based on this standard. Any deviation should be examined
and performance values altered in accordance with the information provided in this section.
Three phase, 415V, 50Hz
Ambient cooling air temperature, 40°C
Altitude - 1000m Duty cycle - S1 (continuous)
Rotation - Clockwise viewed from drive end
Connection - 240 volt Delta/415 volt Star (3kW and below) - 415 volt Delta/720 volt Star (4kW and above)

Voltage and frequency
Standard CMG motors are designed for a power supply of three phase 415V, 50Hz. Motors can be manufactured for any supply between 100V and 1100V and frequencies other than 50Hz. Standard CMG motors wound for a certain voltage at 50Hz can also operate at other voltages at 50Hz and 60Hz without modification, subject to the changes in
their data (see table right).

Starting
All of the following starter options are available through CMG Drives division, and are best supplied together with the motor.
D.O.L. Starters When an electric motor is started by direct connection to the power supply (D.O.L.), it draws a high current, called the ‘starting current’, which is approximately equal in magnitude to the locked rotor current IL. As listed in the performance data, locked rotor current can be up to 8 times the rated current IN of the motor. In circumstances
where the motor starts under no load or where high starting toque is not required, it is preferable to reduce the starting current by one of the following means.
Star - Delta starting
CMG motors 4.0kW and above are suitable for the star-delta
starting method. Through the use of a star-delta starter, the motor terminals are connected in the star configuration during starting, and reconnected to the delta configuration when running.
The benefits of this starting method are a significantly lower starting current, to a value about 1/3 of the D.O.L. starting current, and a corresponding starting torque also reduced to about 1/3 of its D.O.L. value. It should be noted that a second current surge occurs on changeover to the delta connection.
The level of this surge will depend on the speed the motor has reached at the moment of changeover.
Electronic soft starters Through the use of an electronic soft starter, which controls such parameters as current and voltage, the starting sequence can be totally controlled. The starter can
be programmed to limit the amount of starting current. By limiting the rate of the current increase the startup time is extended. This starting method is particularly suitable for centrifugal loads (fans and pumps).

PPD Zone 1, Group I & IIB, T4 Class, Ex d motors Sizes 80 to 315, 0.55 to 200 kW, three phase

CMG’s PPD range of Ex d ‘flameproof’ motors are certified for use in Zone 1 hazardous locations. These motors are designed to contain any sparks within the motor without igniting external vapours. They incorporate features such as a robust cast iron construction and special terminal box to meet the stringent certification requirements.
The complete PPD range covers sizes 80 to 280, three phase 2, 4, 6 & 8 pole, with foot and flange mounting options.

Certiication
The PPD range is specially designed and certified for use in a Zone 1, Group I & IIB, T4 class temperature, Ex d area. SAA certification numbers are AUS Ex 3767X, AUS Ex 3768X, and AUS Ex 3769X for frames 80 to 100, 112 to 180, and 200 to 280 respectively.

Standards and speciications
The main dimensions and rated outputs of the PPD series generally conform to Australian Standard AS/NZS1359 (CENELEC kW-frame size allocation table) and International Standards IEC 60034 and IEC 60072. In addition the motor enclosure and temperature rise are tested to comply with AS2380.2-1991.

Operating parameters
PPD series motors are designed with the following parameters:
• Continuous duty (S1)
• Three phase 415 Volts, 50 Hz power supply
• Ambient temperatures up to 40°C
• Installation at altitudes up to 1000 metres
Performance data is based on these parameters and may need adjustment for different conditions.
Motors can be manufactured for any supply between 100 and 1100 Volts and frequencies 40 Hz, 50 Hz or 60 Hz.
F class insulation, T4 surface temperature PPD series motors have F class insulation and B class temperature rise. This design feature assures cool running
of the motor. Certified Ex d T4 class motors have a maximum allowable surface temperature of 135°C.

Degree of protection
Level of enclosure protection for the PPD series is IP66.

Paint inish
Motors are painted with a high quality enamel finish. The standard colour is light grey (RAL 7038), with other colours available on request.
MEPS compliance PPD motor efficiency levels comply to the minimum efficiency requirements as per AS/NZS 1359.5:2000.

Thermistors
PPD motors are fitted, as standard, with one set of (3) PTC thermistors and are terminated within the main terminal box (auxiliary terminal boxes are available as an option).

Internal connections
Frame sizes 80 to 112 have three terminals suitable for DOL starting. Frame sizes 132 to 280 have six terminals suitable for DOL or Star/Delta starting.
VVVF drive selection PPD Ex d hazardous location motors require thermistors when used in conjunction with VVVF drive to ensure the temperature rise remains below the certified T4 level. Ex d/VVVF drive packages are available including a force ventilation option on frames 200 and above. Please contact
your nearest CMG office for details of requirements.
