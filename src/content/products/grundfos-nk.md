Pump

Non-self-priming single-stage centrifugal volute pump with axial suction port, radial discharge port and horizontal shaft components.

The NK pumps have dimensions and nominal performances according to EN 733 (10 bar) but are designed for 16 bar operation wherever the shaft seal type allows it. NKG pumps according to DIN 24 256 (16 bar) are described in a separate booklet. Pumps up to 25 bar operating pressure are available on request.

Types outside of the official DIN-norm (NK 200 and up) will be called "oversize". Dimensions can differ from other suppliers.

The suction and discharge flanges are according to EN 7005 PN 10 or 16. All pumps are dynamically balanced according to ISO 1940 class 6.3 and impellers are hydraulically balanced.

Pump and motor are mounted on a common baseplate in accordance with DIN 24 259 in all-welded steel. Oversizes have profile base frames.

Due to the pump design the complete bearing assembly including impeller and shaft seal can be dismantled without removing the volute casing from the pipe system (back-pull-out system 3 ).
