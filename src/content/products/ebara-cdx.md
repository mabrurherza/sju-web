Single impeller centrifugal pump with hydraulics in AISI 304 and AISI 316 stainless steel, with radial impeller, with hydraulics entirely in pressed AISI 304 or AISI 316 (L version), with hydroformed components, which ensure sturdiness, hydraulic efficiency and reliability.

The hydroforming process uses a high-pressure fluid (up to 1200 bar) to form the metal.

The hydraulic fluid, in our case water, with increasing pressure pushes the stainless steel to copy the shapes of the template until it comes into contact with the internal walls of the matrix that forms the mould. Hydroforming, which combines the power of a press with the force of water, has significant advantages over traditional processes, namely:

<ul>
<li>• Perfectly smooth shape</li>
<li>• Highly smooth running</li>
<li>• No welding points </il>
</ul>
These features ensure high corrosion resistance, high efficiency with performance above 80% and low losses.
The small size of CDX(L) electric pumps makes them suitable for narrow or difficult to reach spaces.
The versatility of these electric pumps is due to the different types of mechanical seals that can be applied. For further technical information see the Databook
