Rating Definition

Prime: These ratings are applicable for supplying continuous electrical power (at variable load) in lieu of commercially purchased power.
There is no limitation to the annual hours of operation and these models can supply 10% overload power for 1 hour in 12 hours.
Standby: These ratings are applicable for supplying continuous electrical power (at variable load) in the event of a utility power failure.
No overload is permitted on these ratings. The alternators on these models are peak continuous rated (as defined in ISO 8528-3).
